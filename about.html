    <h2>About TeenEd Hub</h2>

    <p>
      TeenEd Hub was created to simplify academic learning for teenagers in a way that feels structured, clear, and motivating.
      We believe education should build confidence, not confusion.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
    <p>
      Our vision is to create a student-focused learning platform where complex topics are broken down into practical, understandable concepts.
      Learning here is guided, supportive, and exam-ready.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Approach</h3>
    <p>
      TeenEd Hub focuses on clarity, logical explanation, structured notes, and smart revision strategies such as “Exam in 1 Hour” summaries.
      We combine academic precision with a calm, distraction-free learning experience.
    </p>

    <h3>Who It’s For</h3>
    <p>
      Designed for students who want to understand deeply, prepare efficiently, and build strong academic foundations — without feeling overwhelmed.
